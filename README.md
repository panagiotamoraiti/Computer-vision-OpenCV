# Computer-vision-OpenCV

Project 1
Detect all cells in microscope images. The program displays and saves the image, in which the different cells are depicted. 
Specifically, for each cell there is a surrounding box (bounding box) and a unique serial number.

For each cell we measure:
1. The area of the cell, defined as the number of pixels that belongs to the cell.
2. The area of the cell's bounding box, as the number of pixels that belongs to the bounding box.
3. The average grayscale value of the pixels contained in the bounding box, in such a way that the execution speed of the calculation 
is independent of the size of the sub-region. To resolve this question, we do not use the 'cv2.integral' function.
